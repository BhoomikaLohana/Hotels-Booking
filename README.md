# Hotels-Booking

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to understand customer trends like booking patterns and cancellations. I've explored factors such as seasonality, lead time, and preferences to optimize marketing, pricing, and services, aiming to boost occupancy rates and improve guest experiences. This project aims to analyze three years of hotel booking data to uncover patterns and insights related to booking cancellations.
Data Overview The dataset represents three years of hotel bookings, primarily from Europe, with Portugal being the main source of bookings. The hotels are categorized into two types: Resorts and City Hotels.

## KEY FINDINGS
In my EDA of hotel booking data, I discovered that August is the busiest month for bookings, while January sees the fewest. Interestingly, August also has the highest cancellation rates, with January having the lowest. When comparing the two types of hotels, city hotels consistently receive more bookings and cancellations each month than resort hotels. The analysis revealed that transient customers, those staying for short periods, are the most common type of guests. Online travel agents (TAs) are the most frequently used booking channel, and bookings labeled as undefined have the highest cancellation rates. Additionally, the majority of guests are first-time visitors, indicating a significant opportunity to enhance customer retention and loyalty programs.
